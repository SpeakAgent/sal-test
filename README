Selenium tests for SAL
======================
Goal: To decrease the time for integration testing through the magic of code!

Prerequisites
-------------
You will need a test user that is already set up on the target server. 

Installation
------------
Set up your virtualenv as usual and pip install ``requirements.txt``. For the purpose of these instructions, I'm going to assume that the name of your env is "saltest".

Download geckodriver (the headless driver for Firefox) from https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases. Unzip it and move it to ``~/.virtualenvs/saltest/bin/``.

Add the TeacherUser username and password to your virtualenv env (don't put this in the code!)::

    echo "export TUSER=username" >> "$VIRTUAL_ENV/bin/postactivate"
    echo "export TPASS=password" >> "$VIRTUAL_ENV/bin/postactivate"

Running the code
----------------
You can either run the files on their own, or you can copy and paste them into the shell. The latter is a good option if you want to further play around with the driver, since ``main()`` returns it.

Good to know
------------

* Waiting is good. It can sometimes take a bit for elements to get onto the page.
* None of the scripts shut down the browser after they run. We should keep it this way for now, so testers can poke around more if needed.
* Use TODO liberally in the comments. 

Documentation
-------------
I have mostly been using the unofficial docs:
